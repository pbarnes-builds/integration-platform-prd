## Persona 1: Enterprise Platform Admin (Customer-Side)
**Type:** Decision Maker / Configurator

**Who they are**  
Owns system integrations on the customer side and is accountable for data correctness and operational reliability. Often technically capable but not a full-time engineer.

**Goals**
- Fast and predictable onboarding
- Confidence that integrations are configured correctly
- Minimal ongoing maintenance and escalation

**Pain Points**
- Hard-to-diagnose integration failures
- Unclear ownership when data issues arise
- Reliance on vendor-side troubleshooting

**Why this persona matters**  
Lack of confidence at this level slows adoption and increases escalations, directly impacting customer satisfaction and expansion potential.

## Persona 2: Solutions Engineer (Internal)
**Type:** Operator / Bottleneck

**Who they are**  
Implements integrations during onboarding while supporting multiple accounts in parallel. Frequently context-switches across configuration, automation logic, reporting, integrations, and client enablement.

**Goals**
- Reusable integration patterns and clear defaults
- Early validation to prevent post-deployment issues
- Reduced reactive troubleshooting during onboarding

**Pain Points**
- One-off integration logic
- Manual testing and late-breaking production issues
- High volume of escalations during critical onboarding phases

**Why this persona matters**  
This persona determines onboarding throughput and cost-to-serve. Improving their leverage delivers system-wide impact.

**Type:** Decision Maker

**Who they are**  
Owns roadmap prioritization, staffing decisions, and long-term platform scalability.

**Goals**
- Predictable delivery timelines
- Reduced operational drag on engineering
- Scalable growth without linear headcount increases
