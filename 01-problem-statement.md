# Problem Statement

As the platform scales to support increasingly complex customer requirements, integrations have evolved toward bespoke logic and ad hoc data mappings as the default delivery approach. While this model enables rapid initial delivery, it lacks a repeatable structure and standardized validation layers, causing integration defects and data quality issues to surface only after production deployment.

This results in several systemic challenges:

- **Extended time-to-value**, driven by repeated discovery, configuration, and troubleshooting during each onboarding cycle, increasing the risk of missed SLAs and compounding delivery pressure on constrained teams.
- **Inconsistent data reliability after initial deployment**, caused by one-off integration logic and limited pre-deployment validation guardrails.
- **High operational dependency on Solutions and Engineering teams**, creating onboarding bottlenecks and reducing available capacity for customer troubleshooting, as Solutions resources are required to context-switch across configuration, automation logic, reporting, integrations, and client enablement.
- **Limited observability and proactive error handling**, making failures difficult to detect, diagnose, and remediate before impacting production environments.

As a result, onboarding effort scales linearly with customer complexity, support burden increases both immediately and over time, and the platform’s ability to support enterprise growth becomes constrained by operational capacity. Without a standardized integration platform, integrations remain a recurring cost center rather than a reusable and scalable product capability.
