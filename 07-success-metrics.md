# Success Metrics

This section defines how the effectiveness of the Integration Platform is measured. Metrics are structured to evaluate improvements in onboarding efficiency, integration reliability, operational load, and long-term scalability. Each metric is intended to drive decisions, not just reporting.

---

## Metric Principles

- Metrics must reflect real operational outcomes, not proxy activity
- Metrics should detect failure early and guide iteration
- Metrics must be attributable to platform changes
- Metrics should be simple enough to interpret and act on

## 1. Time-to-Value Metrics

**Purpose**  
Measure whether onboarding and integration delivery are becoming faster and more predictable.

**Key Metrics**
- Time from integration kickoff to first successful data sync
- Time from configuration completion to production deployment

**Why These Matter**  
If integrations do not reach value faster, the platform is not reducing onboarding friction regardless of architectural improvements.

**Success Signal**
- Measurable reduction in average onboarding duration for supported integration patterns

## 2. Reliability & Quality Metrics

**Purpose**  
Measure whether integrations are correct and stable at launch.

**Key Metrics**
- Percentage of integrations passing validation on first attempt
- Number of integration-related incidents within the first 30 days post-launch
- Ratio of pre-deployment validation errors to post-deployment incidents

**Why These Matter**  
Shifting failures earlier in the lifecycle reduces customer impact and costly rework.

**Success Signal**
- Majority of integration defects detected before production deployment

---

## 3. Operational Load Metrics

**Purpose**  
Measure whether the platform reduces manual effort and reactive work across teams.

**Key Metrics**
- Solutions Engineer hours spent troubleshooting per onboarding
- Number of handoffs between Solutions and Engineering per integration
- Volume of integration-related support tickets in the first 60 days

**Why These Matter**  
High operational load indicates the system relies on people rather than platform leverage.

**Success Signal**
- Decrease in reactive troubleshooting time without increased headcount

---

## 4. Scalability & Leverage Metrics

**Purpose**  
Measure whether the platform enables growth without linear increases in cost or effort.

**Key Metrics**
- Number of onboardings supported per Solutions Engineer per quarter
- Percentage of integrations using standardized templates versus custom logic
- Incremental onboarding cost per customer

**Why These Matter**  
A scalable platform break
