# Goals & Non-Goals

This initiative focuses on transforming integrations from bespoke delivery work into a scalable, repeatable platform capability. The goals emphasize measurable improvements in onboarding efficiency, reliability, and operational leverage, while the non-goals establish clear boundaries to prevent scope expansion that would undermine delivery.

## Goals

1. **Reduce onboarding time-to-value for integration-heavy customers**  
   Standardize integration patterns to minimize repeated discovery, configuration, and troubleshooting during onboarding.

2. **Improve integration reliability and data quality at initial deployment**  
   Introduce consistent validation and testing layers to identify data and logic issues prior to production impact.

3. **Decrease operational dependency on Solutions and Engineering teams**  
   Enable repeatable, low-touch integration workflows that reduce manual intervention and context switching during onboarding.

4. **Increase predictability and observability of integration behavior**  
   Provide clear visibility into integration health and failures to support faster diagnosis and proactive remediation.

5. **Establish a scalable foundation to support enterprise growth**  
   Shift integrations from one-off implementations to a reusable platform capability that scales more efficiently with customer complexity.

## Non-Goals

1. **Rebuilding or replacing the core product architecture**  
   This initiative focuses on integration workflows and tooling, not fundamental changes to the underlying platform.

2. **Supporting every possible third-party system or edge-case integration**  
   Initial scope prioritizes the most common and highest-impact integration patterns rather than exhaustive connector coverage.

3. **Eliminating all custom integration logic**  
   The goal is to reduce unnecessary customization, not prevent flexibility where justified by business requirements.

4. **Delivering a fully self-serve integration marketplace in the initial phase**  
   Early phases emphasize standardization, reliability, and enablement before introducing customer-facing self-service capabilities.

5. **Solving broader data governance or analytics challenges**  
   This initiative addresses integration build simplification and predictable delivery outcomes, not downstream data governance, reporting, or analytics optimization.

6. **Replacing existing support or documentation systems**  
   The platform will integrate with current tools and processes rather than introduce parallel systems.
